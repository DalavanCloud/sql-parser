C++ SQL Parser
=========================

This is a SQL Parser for C++. It parses the given SQL query (SQL99) into
C++ objects along with a map of tables accessed and the operations on each
table.  This parser was derived from [Hyrise SQL Parser](https://github.com/hyrise/sql-parser)
for use in [Envoy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) mysql proxy.
